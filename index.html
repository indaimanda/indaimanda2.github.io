		<h1>HTML Exercise</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the exercise is to put the lessons learned from previous exercises together to build a webpage of your own. This is a rubbish sentence.</p>

		<h2>Previously ...</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li> You looked at the HTML that made up a <a href="http://edinburgh.codefirstgirls.org.uk/courses/html/sample.html">sample page</a></li>
					<li> You looked at the HTML that made up one of your favourite sites</li>
					<li> You changed the attribute of an img tag to change the picture it showed
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h3> Now ...</h3>
			<p>You should:
			<ol>
				<li>Look at the picture of this site</li>
				<li>Try and match up the look of the site to HTML that you've seen so far</li>
				<li>Now build that HTML in your own index.html page</li>
				<li>Check the page in a web browser to see how it compares</li>
				<li>Look back to the slides if you want to</li>
			</ol>
			Here's a picture of a cat
			</p>

			<p>
				<img src="cat.png" />
